# We could explicitly configure the TAP, DAP, etc. for the SAM3X, but using the
# existing configuration is easier. The following line of code would configure
# the TAP, but it is effectively included in the at91sam3ax_8x.cfg, so we do
# not need it here and just leave it for documentation purposes.

# The at91sam3ax_8x.cfg reduces the JTAG clock speed to 500 kHz to make it work
# even if the SAM3X just came out of the reset state and is running at minimum
# speed (4 MHz).
#
# TODO Add code to set a higher clock speed once the controller is properly
#   running. 10 MHz should probably be fine.
